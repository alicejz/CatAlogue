            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>Originating from California, USA, Ragdolls have a medium-length coat that comes in a captivating range of colours,
                including chocolate, lilac, red, and much more. While they rank among the largest cat breeds of approximately
                15 to 20 pounds, Ragdolls are renowned for their gentle and affectionate personality. With a lifespan of up to 17
                years, Ragdolls earned their reputation as the most ideal lap cat due to their unique ability. These cats go completely 
                limp on someone's lap when petted, akin to a plush 'rag doll,' making them the perfect cuddle companions. These felines
                possess a remarkably easygoing personality and are ready to befriend everyone they meet. To ensure your Ragdoll stays content,
                snuggling sessions are essential, as they eagerly anticipate belly rubs while perched on your lap, ensuring both your cat's happiness
                and sharing heartwarming moments together.

            <h1>Grooming and Care</h1>
            <p>Despite the hefty amount of fur Ragdolls have, it's surprisingly easy to maintain. These felines have a silky single coat, requiring only 
                a gentle brushing twice a week to help avoid tangles. This minimal grooming routine sets them apart from other medium-haired cat breeds, making
                Ragdolls are an excellent choice for those seeking a cuddly companion with minimal shedding. Moreover, Ragdolls lack an undercoat, which means they 
                shed less compared to cats with denser fur. This is a definite perk if you want to enjoy snuggles with your furry friend without constantly battling 
                fur around the house. In addition to grooming, it's essential to keep your Ragdoll's nails in check with weekly trims and provide them with high-quality
                scratching posts throughout your home. Since Ragdolls are moderately active and sociable by nature, engaging in regular playtime and interaction with your 
                feline friend is key. This not only strengthens your bond but also helps prevent behavioural issues stemming from boredom.
